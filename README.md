# paper_drift_visualization



# dependencies
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```



# usage
```sh
$ python app.py
```

parameters such as window size, max group size can be changed in preprocessed.py and the critical drift threshold in app_background.py


# credits
This work is very heavily inspired by my bachelor's thesis. "The drift visualization methods are part of my bachelor's thesis "Concept Drift Prediction Based on Event and Sensor Data Streams - An Interactive Drift Visualization Method" at the at the TUM School of Computation, Information and Technology, Department of Computer Science, Chair of Information Systems and Business Process Management (i17) and based on the concepts and data set presented in F. Stertz, S. Rinderle-Ma, and J. Mangler, â€œAnalyzing process concept drifts based on sensor event streams during runtime", 2020

The folder data which contains yaml.xes-files that can be used as test inputs are owned by the Chair of Information Systems and Business Process Management (i17) at the Technical University of Munich."
